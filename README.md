This is a project meant for the LSE Data Science Society's Project Showcase. 
This project provides an interface which users can use to forecast prices of commodities based on their selection. 
The forecasting is done through: 1) sentiment analysis which uses reddit and the guardian as sentiment sources and 2) ARIMA time series forecasting.
Based on weightage allocated to sentiment analysis and market volatility, our interface gives the final forecast value.
